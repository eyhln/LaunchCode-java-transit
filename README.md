# Transit

This simple command line application allows the user to select a St. Louis transit stop and receive the time of the next train arrival. It uses a SQLite database of STL transit data with bus timings removed to reduce its size. The program accounts for differing weekend and holiday schedules, as well as overnight schedules with listings in hours 25 through 27 of the 'day'.
