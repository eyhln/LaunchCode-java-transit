# Transit

This simple command line application allows the user to select a St. Louis transit stop and receive the time of the next train arrival. It uses an SQLite database of STL transit data that I massaged to remove bus timings and reduce its size. The program accounts for differing weedend and holiday schedules, as well as overnight schedules with listings in hours 25 through 27 of the 'day'.
